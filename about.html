        One of the coolest features in the room is the airbag, which isn’t just
        your average airbag. <br />It’s got the very latest technology developed
        to mimic a real landing ramp, but with the benefits of airbag impact
        absorption if anything goes wrong.<br />
        Basically – you can practice your new trick into an airbag and if you
        land it, you can ride away. “It’s like landing in powder”, co-owner
        Joakim Kumlin explains.<br />
        It could be the most revolutionary thing to hit freestyle action sport
        in years.<br />
        To make sure all extreme sport junkies get to reap the benefits of this,
        The Dome has created specially designed skis and snowboards with wheels
        so that snow sport people can practice their tricks together with the
        bikers, skaters and kickbikers.
